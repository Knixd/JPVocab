			<p class="text-center lead">Someone once said, <i>"Learning Japanese is like going to the gym."</i></p>
			<p>
				Yes. You read it right and I tend to agree. Why?
			</p> 
			<p>
				Those who go to the gym will go no matter what anyone says; those who don't weren't going to go anyways.
			</p>
			<p>
				 The same is true with learning Japanese. In the end it's up to you. This is harsh and I'm sorry. But from my experience living in Japan it's the truth.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, because I was like you before I spending money and time moving to Japan to learn Japanese going zero-N2 in 8 months, I want to help out those who are like me, serious and doers, but who maybe can't move to Japan like I did. These legendary people don't need coaxing or pep talks (would be nice though!) because they're on a mission.

				If this sounds like you, then you're not alone friend. For you, and no one else (you know who you are ;) ), here's a tool based on studying the success of <b>polygots</b> (people who master many languages) that is definitely worth the $. Face it, some methods are more efficient than others. Make sure you quickly try their free trial before buying, promise me ok? Then skim through the 1700+ reviews on the site. Hey, one step at a time right? You'll get there if you keep taking steps.
